# Work Day Scheduler
> Homework Assignment #5

This is a scheduler that changes color depending on the time of the work day. 

## Features
This is a timeblock for each hour starting at 9am until 5pm.

The color changes depending on if the hour is on the past, present, or future.

You can add an event to each hour and when you click save everything is saved to local storage. This way when you reload the events stay displayed.

When a new day starts everything that is in each time block is erased.
